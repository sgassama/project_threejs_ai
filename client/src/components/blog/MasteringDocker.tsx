            <h3>1.1 Docker Bridge Networks</h3>
            <p className={`flex flex-col`}>
              Docker networking goes beyond simple port mapping. Let's explore the intricacies of Docker bridge networks, enabling seamless communication between containers.
            </p>

            <section>
              <h4>Example: Creating a Custom Bridge Network</h4>
              <pre>
                # Create a custom bridge network
                docker network create my-network

                # Run containers in the custom network
                docker run --network my-network --name container-1 -d nginx
                docker run --network my-network --name container-2 -d nginx
            </pre>
              <br/>
              <p>
                In this example, we've created a custom bridge network named <code>my-network</code> and launched two Nginx containers connected to this network. They can now communicate with each other over the custom bridge network.
              </p>

            <h3>1.2 Docker Volumes</h3>
            <p>
              Docker volumes aren't just for persistent data; they can significantly enhance performance and facilitate data sharing between containers. Let's explore advanced Docker volume usage.
            </p>

            <section>
              <h4>Example: Named Volume for Data Sharing</h4>
              <pre>
                            # Create a named volume
                            docker volume create my-data

                            # Run a container with the named volume
                            docker run -v my-data:/app/data --name data-container -d busybox
                        </pre>
              <br/>
              <p>
                In this example, we create a named volume <code>my-data</code> and mount it to a container named <code>data-container</code>. This allows seamless data sharing between containers and ensures data persistence.

          <h2>Chapter 2: Docker Compose Mastery</h2>

          <section>
            <h3>2.1 Advanced Docker Compose Features</h3>
            <p>
              Docker Compose isn't just about simple service definitions. Let's explore advanced features like environment files, multiple Compose files, and scaling services.
            </p>

            <section>
              <h4>Example: Using Multiple Compose Files</h4>
              <pre>
                          <code>
                            # docker-compose.base.yml
                            version: '3'
                            services:
                              web:
                                image: nginx:alpine

                            # docker-compose.override.yml
                            version: '3'
                            services:
                              web:
                                ports:
                                  - "8080:80"
                          </code>
                        </pre>
              <br/>
              <p>
                By splitting your Docker Compose configuration into base and override files, you maintain a clean and flexible setup. The override file can define environment-specific configurations without modifying the base file.
              </p>

            <h3>2.2 Docker Compose Networks</h3>
            <p>
              Docker Compose allows for sophisticated network configurations, enabling containers to communicate seamlessly. Let's explore the intricacies of Docker Compose networks.
            </p>

            <section>
              <h4>Example: Custom Networks in Docker Compose</h4>
              <pre>
                          <code>
                            # docker-compose.yml
                            version: '3'
                            services:
                              web:
                                image: nginx:alpine
                                networks:
                                  - frontend
                              db:
                                image: postgres:alpine
                                networks:
                                  - backend

                            networks:
                              frontend:
                              backend:
                          </code>
                        </pre>
              <br/>
              <p>
                In this example, we define two custom networks, <code>frontend</code> and <code>backend</code>, and assign services to specific networks. This ensures a clear separation of concerns and enhanced security within the Docker Compose setup.

          <h2>Chapter 3: Optimizing Docker Images</h2>

          <section>
            <h3>3.1 Dockerfile Best Practices</h3>
            <p>
              Optimizing Dockerfiles is crucial for creating efficient and secure Docker images. Let's explore best practices that enhance image build performance and security.
            </p>

            <section>
              <h4>Example: Reducing Image Layers</h4>
              <pre>
                          <code>
                            # Bad Practice: Creating Too Many Layers
                            FROM node:14
                            WORKDIR /app
                            COPY package*.json ./
                            RUN npm install
                            COPY . .

                            # Good Practice: Reducing Layers
                            FROM node:14 as builder
                            WORKDIR /app
                            COPY package*.json ./
                            RUN npm install

                            FROM node:14
                            WORKDIR /app
                            COPY --from=builder /app .
                            COPY . .
                          </code>
                        </pre>
              <br/>
              <p>
                In this example, the bad practice creates unnecessary layers, while the good practice consolidates commands to minimize layers. This results in faster builds and smaller image sizes.

            <h3>4.1 Introduction to Kubernetes</h3>
            <p>
              Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, takes container orchestration to the next level. Let's embark on an introduction to Kubernetes and explore its key concepts.
            </p>
