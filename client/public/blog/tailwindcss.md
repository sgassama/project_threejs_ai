To illustrate the power of Tailwind, let's create a simple landing page using Tailwind:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Tailwind Example</title>
  <link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container mx-auto p-5">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center">Tailwind CSS Rocks!</h1>
    <p class="text-center">Tailwind CSS makes web development a breeze.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we utilize Tailwind's utility classes to:

- Center the text horizontally and vertically using `.mx-auto` and `.text-center`
